### About
Hi! Before starting to introduce myself, I just want to take a second to thank you, whoever you are, for visiting my github page. It means a lot that you are taking some time out of your day to get to know me and look at the things that I have built.

My name is Roger Zhang and I am first-generation Chinese born and raised in Quebec City, Qc, Canada. I graduated from Mcgill University with a BEng in Software Engineering. I am currently a Software Engineer at Wayfair.

What I enjoy the most in life is going on adventures by getting obsessed with different disciplines and learning new skills. For example, in the autumn of 2021, I decided I wanted to pursue boxing until I either injured myself or achieved an amateur fight. I then spent about a year training for around 2 hours a day 4-5 times a week. Spoiler alert: I didnâ€™t end up getting an amateur fight.

All that to say, I love learning new things and creating friendships doing it. I love getting out of my comfort zone: From creating healthcare-related apps to working in the finance industry to creating new AutoCAD modules for the mining industry, I am always willing to get my hands dirty and nerd out about a new field.
